=============
CosmoSim
=============

CosmoSim is a python package to create, run and output n-body cosmology simulations. CosmoSim also provides
some basic analysis tools.

Here is a basic example:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from cosmosim import simulator

    blah blah blah


This produces a basic simulation with an output of an mp4 file, with an example screenshot:

.. figure::     ../file1here.png
   :align:     center
   :width:     80%

CosmoSim can perform simulations using the particle-particle (PP), particle-mesh (PM) and particle-particle-particle-
mesh (P3M). It has the in-built analysis tools to construct correlation functions and power spectra.
